# Welcome to the LOGIQ Observability and Kubernetes Glossary

We've built this glossary to help you understand the key terms you will encounter in your journey with Kubernetes and Observability and Monitoring for Kubernetes and other cloud and bare-metal infrastructure. You can use the tabs on the top of this page to switch between the Kubernetes and Observability spaces on the site. Use the site-wide searchbar or the links in the left navigation menu within each space to navigate to a topic of your choosing. 

You can also contribute towards adding more terminology or improving the explanations we've used by hitting the Edit icon near the title of each article.
