# Sources

Sources in observability refers to all of the sources across your systems and applications that generate log data. You can connect your observability platform to these data sources to ingest log data and further parse, smoothen, analyse, and visualize. 

Most observability platform ship with pre-built connectors that support data ingestion from popular cloud applications and infrastructure service providers. In the absence of pre-built connectors, you can leverage log collectors such as Fluentd or Logstash.
