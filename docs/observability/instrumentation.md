# Instrumentation

Instrumentation is either code, technique, or software tools that gather data from the various components in your system in real-time. Examples of instrumentation include counters that are used to count the number of operations that succeeded or failed within a system, or timers that measure the time taken for an operation to complete or a request to be received. 

Prometheus is another example of observability instrumentation that lets you monitor and query several metrics on distributed systems, stores them as time/date series, and helps these metrics become searchable, scannable, and retrieved.
