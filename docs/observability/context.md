# Context

Context or contextual data is usually background information or additional information about a piece of data that gives you a broader understanding of that data. In Observability, contextual data can be a collection of tags, fields, statuses, or other information from which you can derive more information about the internal state of your system. Contextual data can include application and system-level metrics, performance metrics, or even metadata about running processes.
