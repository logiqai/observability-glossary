# Dimensionality

The **dimensionality** of data refers to how many fields or attributes a piece of data has attached to it. Examples of low-dimensionality data include metrics and flat logs. High-dimensionality data includes anything that can support many fields or attributes, including JSON blobs, structs, and objects.
