# Traces

Traces enable you to analyse and understand the entire lifecycle of a process across ditributed systems. While logs and metrics help you understand the behavior and performace of individual components, traces give you a holistic view of an operation across different components of a distributed system. Using traces, you can uncover every aspect of an operation or request as they are carried out or passed through each of its touchpoints in a system. 

Traces are especially useful to derive system health, identify and remediate threats and anomalies, discover gridlocks within a system, and highlight areas for overall performance and resource optimizations.
