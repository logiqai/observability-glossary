# Observability

Observability is the ability to gain knowledge about the internal working and states of a system by observing their external outputs. In the realm of IT infrastructure, observability involves monitoring and analyzing actual events from event logs generated by applications, software, and infrastructure to identify patterns and derive actionable insights.

An observability platform helps IT organizations implement observability across their applications, software, and infrastructure through the aggregation and analysis of the logs that they generate.
