# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source container orchestration platform that automates most of the manual process involved in deploying, managing, and scaling containerized workloads and services. Kubernetes has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem and services, support, and tools that are widely available.

Kubernetes containers are a great way to bundle and run your applications across multiple clusters of physical and virtual machines. It enables you to optimize resources needed to run your enterprise applications, control and automate application deployments and updates, and scale containerized applications and their resources on the go. 

The declarative nature of Kubernetes also enables you to ensure that your applications are always running as they were designed to.
