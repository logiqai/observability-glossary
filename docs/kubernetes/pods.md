# Pods

A pod is the smallest object in a Kubernetes cluster and is a group of running containers on your cluster. A pod typically suns a single primary container while supporting the running of optional sidecar containers to aid monitoring and observability. The containers in a pod share storage and networking resources and a common configuration for how to run the containers.
