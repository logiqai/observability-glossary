# Container

A container is a lightweight and portable executable image that packages an application or software and its runtime dependencies. Containerization of an application enables it to be deployed easily and consistently regardless of the environment it is being deployed in.  A container includes everything an application needs to run including code, runtime dependencies, system tools, libraries, and configurations.
