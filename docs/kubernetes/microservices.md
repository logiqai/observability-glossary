# Microservices

Microservices, also known as the microservice architecture, is an architectural design that enables you to distribute application components using containers that work together as a collection of services. Due to their distributed nature, microservices are easy to test, maintain, deploy, and scale, while being highly reusable and replicable across different applications.
