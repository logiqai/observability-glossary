# K3s

[K3s](https://k3s.io/) is a highly available, lightweight, and fully compliant Kubernetes distribution. K3s is packaged as a single binary, thereby reducing dependencies and minimizing installation, run, and auto-update steps that youâ€™d typically have to take while managing a production Kubernetes cluster. As K3s is lightweight, you can run a cluster on machines with as little as 512 MB RAM and upwards. 

K3s comes bundled with a local storage provider, a service load balancer, a Helm controller, and the Traefik ingress controller. A single binary and process encapsulate the operation of all Kubernetes control plane components, allowing K3s to automate and manage complex cluster operations like distributing certificates.
