# kubeadm

kubeadm is a Kubernetes utility that provides "fast paths" for creating Kubernetes clusters. With kubeadm, you can deploy a minimum viable Kubernetes cluster. 

It is advisable to use kubeadm as the basis of all your deployments as it makes it easier to maintain a standard across your clusters. kubeadm depends on additional, higher-level tooling to be built on top of it to carry out operations like installing the Kubernetes dashboard, addons, and monitoring solutions.
