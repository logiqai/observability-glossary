# The Kubernetes API

The Kubernetes API forms the core of the Kubernetes control plane and exposes an HTTP API that enables users, cluster components, and external components to communicate with each other. You can use the Kubernetes API to query and manipulate the state of pods, namespaces, events, etc. 

While kubectl and kubeadm lets you perform most of these operations, you can still access the Kubernetes API directly using REST calls.
